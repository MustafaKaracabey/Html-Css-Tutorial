/*Width and Height
    Reference Docs : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp
    The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
    The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

    auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value


Remember that the height and width properties do not include padding,
borders, or margins! They set the h
eight/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!

The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
